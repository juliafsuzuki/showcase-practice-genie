# Showcase Practice — Genie

A personal practice web app for competitive ballroom dancers learning showcase choreography. Pick a showcase, drill it one rhythmical phrase at a time, with a music-locked metronome, live count overlay, mirror mode, and adjustable playback speed.

- **Two showcases** — *Friend Like Me* (Swing, 4/4) and *A Whole New World* (Waltz, 3/4)
- **Phrase-based drilling** — each showcase split into 11–14 named musical phrases with timestamps and counts
- **Music-locked metronome** — Web Audio API click track that arms/disarms with the play button, phase-aligned to the song's downbeat
- **Live count overlay** — counts 1-2-3-4 (4/4) or 1-2-3 (3/4) in time with the music
- **Variable speed** — ¼×, ½×, ¾×, 1× practice tempos
- **Mirror mode** — flips the video horizontally for follow-along practice
- **Repeat mode** — auto-rewinds the current phrase

vercel deploy --prod
```

The repo includes `vercel.json` configuring static hosting.

## Adding a New Showcase

1. Drop your phrase MP4s into `clips/<showcase-id>/` (numbered, e.g. `01_Intro.mp4`)
2. Append a new entry to `window.SHOWCASES` in `assets/showcases.js` with `id`, `title`, `subtitle`, `bpm`, `countsPerBar`, `duration`, and a `phrases` array of `{name, start, end, counts, file}`
3. Refresh — the showcase dropdown picks it up automatically
